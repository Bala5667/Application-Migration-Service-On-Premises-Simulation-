üîπ Step 1: Create the Source Server (EC2 Instance)

1Ô∏è‚É£ Launched a new EC2 instance (Source Server) in us-east-1.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Installed Apache Web Server and hosted a simple HTML file.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Verified that the webpage was accessible using the EC2 instance's public IP.

User Data for Apache and HTML Setup:
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1>Welcome to AWS Application Migration Service</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html

üîπ Step 2: Create IAM User with Required Permissions

1Ô∏è‚É£ Created an IAM User specifically for AMS migration.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Attached the following IAM Policies to this user:

[AmazonEC2FullAccess, AmazonS3FullAccess, AWSApplicationMigrationAgentInstallationPolicy, AWSApplicationMigrationFullAccess]

3Ô∏è‚É£ Generated the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for this IAM user.

üîπ Step 3: Register Source Server in AWS MGN

1Ô∏è‚É£ Navigated to AWS Application Migration Service (AMS) in the AWS console.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Clicked ‚ÄúAdd server‚Äù and entered the Access Key ID & Secret Access Key of the created IAM user.
3Ô∏è‚É£ AWS provided two commands for installing the AWS MGN agent on the source server:
Download the installer command, Run the installer command
4Ô∏è‚É£ Copied and ran these commands on the source server (EC2) to install AWS MGN Agent.

üîπ Step 4: Verify the Source Server in AWS MGN

1Ô∏è‚É£ Once installation completed, AWS MGN automatically created an internal replication EC2 instance.
2Ô∏è‚É£ The instance appeared under AWS Application Migration Service ‚Üí Source Servers.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Changed the security group of this new instance to allow all TCP connections.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Verified that the Apache web page from the source server was accessible from the new instance.

üîπ Step 5: Modify Launch Template for Target Server
1Ô∏è‚É£ Modified the default launch template to match the desired target instance type:
Instance Type: t3.medium
Auto-Assign Public IP: Enabled
2Ô∏è‚É£ Set this as the default version of the launch template.

üîπ Step 6: Wait for Replication to Reach 100%
1Ô∏è‚É£ Monitored replication progress under AWS MGN ‚Üí Source Servers.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Once replication reached 100%, clicked "Create Test Instance".
3Ô∏è‚É£ AWS automatically deleted the "AWS Application Migration Service Conversion Server" and replaced it with a Replication Server.

üîπ Step 7: Perform Cutover to Production
1Ô∏è‚É£ Clicked "Mark as Ready for Cutover".
2Ô∏è‚É£ Clicked "Launch Cutover Instance", which automatically created the final target server.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Changed the security group of the new production server to allow web traffic.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Tested the IP of the new production server and verified that the HTML file was successfully replicated.

üîπ Step 8: Delete the Source Server
1Ô∏è‚É£ Once the new production server was fully operational, clicked "Finalize Cutover".
2Ô∏è‚É£ This deleted the old source server from AMS, completing the migration process.

‚úÖ Final Outcome
Successfully migrated a web server (EC2) from a source to a target AWS environment using AMS.
The production server had the same content as the original source server.
Source server was safely decommissioned after migration.
